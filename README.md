# LMG-Hackathon
The problem set was to predict that which customer will visit the upcoming new stores . 




The prediction was entirely  based on the demographic and transnational history of customer. Also the stores data set was given for the analysis.    

I secured rank 10 in the competetion . 

#### Approach
My approach towards the problem was simple rule based segregation of the customers base and mapping thier corresponding stores on the basis of distance travelled. I had calculated the distance from the new coming stores to all the rest of stores, thereby giving me a proximate periphery of what stores are likely to be visited, on the basis of distance.
