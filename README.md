# LMG-Hackathon
The problem set was to predict that which customer will visit the upcoming new stores . The prediction was entirely  based on the demographic and transnational history of customer. Also the stores data set was given for the analysis.    

I secured rank 10 in the competetion . 

#### Aproach
My approach towards the problem was simple rule based segregation of the customers and mapping thier corresponding stores.
